<p>#How has it changed from the beginning of the season?
Interestingly, Miami’s EPA has gone from 9 to 11.1. In other words, through eight weeks, the Dolphins’ expected points added in the redzone has gone up by two points when compared with the first three weeks of the season, so they’re doing a bit better. While its unlikely that Miami continues to have such a strong EPA the rest of the season, they have maintained their hot start through the first half of the season.</p>

<p>To create this chart, I first created a dataframe for all NFL teams with the number of redzone plays and total EPA for the first 3 weeks using the pbp data. I then did the same process for all teams through eight weeks. After combining those two dataframes into a single one, I was able to load the data into a dumbbell chart. I then reordered the chart to show teams with the highest EPA (as distinguished by the blue dot) through eight weeks first.</p>
<p>A couple things to point out on this chart: the Chiefs are the top team in terms of EPA through eight weeks. This checks out because KC is 5-2 and has scored 223 points so far this season. One team that has improved since week three is the Atlanta Falcons. Atlanta was one of the worst teams in redzone EPA through three weeks but have jumped into fourth, right behind the undefeated Philadelphia Eagles.</p>
<p>If we take a look at ESPN’s (<a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/34883241/nfl-week-9-power-rankings-2022-1-32-poll-reason-hope" class="uri">https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/34883241/nfl-week-9-power-rankings-2022-1-32-poll-reason-hope</a>) week 9 power rankings, we get 1. Bills, 2. Eagles, 3. Chiefs, 4. Cowboys, 5. Vikings. How about the top five from out chart? 1. Chiefs, 2. Titans, 3. Eagles, 4. Falcons, 5. Vikings. If we compare the two, there are three teams —— that overlap, so there might be something to teams with good EPAs.</p>
<p>If we glance at the bottom of our chart, were see some of the league’s worst teams, but the one surprise is the Buffalo Bills, the eighth-lowest on our graph. The Bills are Super Bowl contenders based on record (6-1) and team talent. Could this spell trouble in Buffalo? Probably not, but it’s something to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>The last team I want to look at is the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Bucs’ struggles have been well-documented this year, but using EPA as a metric to evaluate offense, the Bucs are one of the worst teams in the league through eight games, not that they were stellar through the first three, but they at least were better. All in all, it’s been a tough season for Brady and the Bucs.</p>
